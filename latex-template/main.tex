\section{Fitting images perfectly}

So, fitting images has ever been a hectic problem for me just because I am an idiot. Here is literally the easiest way to fit images lol. You can use [scale=*] for custom scaling to the figures if necessary.

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,keepaspectratio]{images/gojo_pfp.png}
    % height=\textheight does what it's expected to do similarly as well
