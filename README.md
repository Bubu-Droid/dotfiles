# ARCH i3 Dotfiles

This repository contains my ARCH i3 dotfiles. It also contains:

- Instructions for setting up these dotfiles on a freshly
  installed system
- My custom LaTeX template, which I use and sometimes share

Thanks a lot to @rosemarys_baby for helping me out whenever
I was clueless during my first Arch installation.

After being almost a complete year into using Arch as my
primary OS, I get why the veterans are so fixated on making
the newbies read the
[Arch Wiki installation guide][archinstallguide].
Read the Wiki people. :joy:

A few resources for installing Arch Linux:

- [Arch Wiki installation guide][archinstallguide]
- [Arch installation guide by Mental Outlaw][mentaloutarchinstall]
- [Setting up Graphical Environments and
  Users by Luke Smith][archlinuxlukesmith]

## Ricing a fresh system with my Dotfiles

- Follow [this][ricing] guided manual for ricing the setup.

Here is the screenshot of my current rice. My previous
rices can be found in [dotfiles-screenshots/][dotfilesss]
directory. Both dark and light theme based wallpapers
can be found in [wallpapers/][wallpapers] directory.
