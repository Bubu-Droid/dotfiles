# ARCH i3 dotfiles

This repo contains my ARCH i3 dotfiles. I also go through the process of
installing ARCH manually after which I also add the method for setting up
the dotfiles using my configs. I've also added my LaTeX template since I
sometimes need to share them with others.

## Why add installation procces and why not use archinstall to install ARCH?

I've seen a few ARCH users online who scream at people for installing ARCH
via archinstall. In fact, until the last moment I tried installing ARCH using
archinstall too. But the difficulty was that it was throwing an error everytime
I was trying to bare metal install ARCH. Finally I gave up on archinstall and
proceeded with manual install. I was helped a lot by @rosemarys_baby during the
install without whom I wouldn't have been able to install ARCH. Not all ARCH
users are maniacs :3 . But while installing ARCH following the ARCH wiki, I got
stuck a few times and some of them turned out to be facts that were missing in
the ARCH wiki. This is why I add this tutorial that anyone with UEFI mode and
with GPT partitions for disks.
